```

### Building

```bash
# Build the enhanced DXT extension
npm run build:enhanced

# Build legacy version
npm run build:legacy

# Clean and rebuild
npm run rebuild

# Run tests
npm test

# Validate the built extension
npm run validate
```

### Adding New Tools

1. Create AppleScript in `src/scripts/enhanced/`
2. Add tool definition to `src/server/index-enhanced.js`
3. Update the manifest if needed
4. Rebuild the extension
5. Test thoroughly with different OmniFocus configurations

## Architecture

The enhanced extension uses an improved Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that:

1. Receives commands from Claude Desktop via JSON-RPC
2. Routes to appropriate AppleScript (enhanced or original)
3. Executes AppleScript with proper parameter handling
4. Manages complex operations like batch creation and searches
5. Returns formatted, actionable results to Claude

### Key Improvements

- **Modular Script System**: Separate enhanced scripts for maintainability
- **Parameter Validation**: Robust input handling and error messages
- **Batch Processing**: Efficient handling of multiple operations
- **Advanced Date Parsing**: Natural language date interpretation
- **State Management**: Better handling of task relationships

## Troubleshooting

### "Not authorized to send Apple events to OmniFocus" (error -1743)

This is the most common issue. Claude Desktop runs the extension via `node`, which needs macOS Automation permission for OmniFocus.

**First install**: macOS should show a permission dialog the first time you use an OmniFocus tool. Click **Allow**.

**If the dialog doesn't appear** or you accidentally denied it:

1. Reset Apple Events permissions:
   ```bash
   tccutil reset AppleEvents
   ```
2. Restart Claude Desktop
3. Use any OmniFocus tool - the permission dialog should appear
4. Click **Allow**

You can verify the permission in **System Settings > Privacy & Security > Automation** - look for `node` with OmniFocus enabled.

### Extension Not Loading

1. Check Claude Desktop logs: `~/Library/Logs/Claude/`
2. Ensure OmniFocus is installed and running
3. Try reinstalling the extension

### Tasks Not Appearing

1. Ensure OmniFocus default document is open
2. Check that you're not in a filtered view

### Common Issues and Solutions

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| "Not authorized" (-1743) | Run `tccutil reset AppleEvents` and restart Claude Desktop |
| "OmniFocus not found" | Ensure OmniFocus is in /Applications |
| "No tasks found" | Check search terms and task availability |
| "Multiple matches" | Be more specific in task names |
| "Cannot create recurring" | Ensure OmniFocus Pro features are available |

## Security

This extension:
- ✅ Only reads and writes to OmniFocus via AppleScript
- ✅ Does not store or transmit personal data
- ✅ Runs entirely locally on your machine
- ✅ Requires explicit user permission for automation
- ✅ Open source for full transparency

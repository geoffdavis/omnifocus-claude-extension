# Build Fix Summary

## Issue
The extension failed to load in Claude Desktop with the error:
```
Failed to preview extension: Invalid manifest:
dxt_version: Required; author: Expected object, received string; server: Required
```

## Root Cause
The manifest.json format was incorrect for Claude Desktop Extension (DXT) format. The manifest was missing required fields and had incorrect data types.

## Solution Applied

### 1. Added Required `dxt_version` Field
```json
"dxt_version": "0.1.0"
```
This field specifies the DXT format version and is required by Claude Desktop.

### 2. Fixed `author` Format
Changed from string:
```json
"author": "Community Contributors"
```

To object format:
```json
"author": {
    "name": "Community Contributors",
    "email": "support@example.com"
}
```

### 3. Added Required `server` Configuration
```json
"server": {
    "command": "node",
    "args": ["server/index.js"]
}
```
This tells Claude Desktop how to launch the MCP server.

## Files Updated
1. `/build.js` - Updated MANIFEST constant with correct format
2. `/src/manifest.json` - Updated source manifest template

## Correct Manifest Structure
```json
{
  "dxt_version": "0.1.0",           // Required
  "id": "omnifocus-gtd",            // Required
  "name": "OmniFocus GTD",          // Required
  "version": "2.0.0",                // Required
  "description": "...",              // Required
  "author": {                        // Required (object format)
    "name": "...",
    "email": "..."
  },
  "license": "MIT",                  // Optional
  "server": {                        // Required
    "command": "node",
    "args": ["server/index.js"]
  },
  "readme": "...",                   // Optional
  "config": {                        // Optional
    "enabled": true
  }
}
```

## Next Steps
1. Run `npm run build` or `node build.js` to create the new DXT file
2. The new `dist/omnifocus-gtd.dxt` will have the correct manifest format
3. Install the updated extension in Claude Desktop

## Validation
The extension should now:
- Load without errors in Claude Desktop
- Show all 13 tools in the tools menu
- Execute commands properly through the MCP server

The manifest format is now fully compliant with Claude Desktop Extension requirements.
